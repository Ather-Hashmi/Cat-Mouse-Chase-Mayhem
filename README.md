###Introduction
The Cat Mouse Game is a graphical game built using the Pygame library in Python. The game utilizes graphs as data structures and the Dijkstra algorithm to implement the cat chasing the mouse (player) scenario. In this game, the mouse (player) needs to collect cheese while avoiding the cat. The player must survive as long as possible without being caught by the cat.

###Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.0 or above installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
bash

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the mouse.

Collect cheese while avoiding the cat.

Survive as long as possible without being caught.

###Features
-Engaging and interactive gameplay with a cat chasing a mouse scenario.
-Graph-based implementation using the Pygame module.
-Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating the cat's optimal path.
-Mouse (player) movement controlled by arrow keys.
-Cheese collection mechanism to increase score.
-Game over screen displaying the final score.
